Keyboard Layer/2
----------------

The brief description

    Keyboard Layer/2 is the alternative keyboard layers and keyboard layouts
    switcher for OS/2 version 4.0, 4.5 and eComStation. In addition driver
    displays the current keyboard layer via the special indicator.

    In case you're satisfied with standard keyboard switcher Keyboard
    Layer/2 can be used simply as a current layer indicator. Just make sure
    that "Don't touch my keyboard!" is selected in options.
      
    According to "IBM OS/2 Warp 4 Keyboards and code Layouts" switching
    between latin and national keyboard layers should work in the following
    countries:

    The country and keyboard layouts
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Arabian countries (ar and ar470)
    Bulgaria (bg and bg241)
    Greece (gk and el459)
    Israel (il)
    Latvia (lv)
    Macedonia (mk)
  * Russia (ru441 and ru443)
    Serbia and Chernogoria (sr)
    Thailand (th and th190)
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
      
    * It is the only tested country

Important notes
---------------

    If you have the HPFS386 Local Security feature enabled, you must make
    sure that the Keyboard Layer/2 directory is always readable.

Known problems
--------------

  - If the window of any program using similar with Keyboard Layer/2 pop-up 
    algorithm will be overlayed with the indicator window most likely that
    they will fight for superiority with 100% CPU loading. In this case
    simply drag away one from another.

  - ALT and SHIFT switching method works only in combination: (LEFT ALT and 
    LEFT SHIFT) or (RIGHT ALT and RIGHT SHIFT). Don't try to use left ALT 
    with right SHIFT and vice versa.
    
  - In full screen OS/2 sessions the standard switching is locked.

  - With "Transparent focus" enabled Keyboard Layer/2 can not be activated
    from a task list.

  - The mode "Transparent focus" does not work with enabled (modes) "Move
    Pointer to Focus", "Activate Window a Pointer" checkboxes and disabled
    "Only When Pointer is Moved" ones in the NPS WPS Enhancer.
